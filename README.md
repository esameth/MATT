# MATT
Creates benchmark protein structural alignments, with a focus on transmembrane proteins. Files are taken from ECOD and alignments are done by Matt. 

## ECOD - Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains
Hierarchical classification of protein domains according to their evolutionary relationships. Domain structures are represented by an X - Possible homology level, H - Homology level, T - Topology level, and F - Family level.

## Matt - Multiple Alignment with Translations and Twists
Multiple protein structure alignment program. It takes in a file containing a list of pdb file locations on disk, runs an alignment for each protein hierarchy level, and outputs a fasta, txt, pdb, and spt file.
